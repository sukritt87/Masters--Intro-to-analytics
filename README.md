# Masters--Intro-to-analytics
I am currently pusuing Masters in Analytics. This Repository contains all the projects I have done in my first course.

Project 1: This project consists of very basic R queries ranging from arithmatic operation to creating a simple bar graph
This includes following files:
a) ALY_6000_Project_1-1 - Instruction set manual with questions (1-30). Questions 31-33 are for the report creation
b) ds_salaries - Dataset file for analyzing and report creation
c) Tripathi_Project1_Script - R script file with answers to all the questions present in the instruction set
d) Tripathi_Project1_Report - Final report
